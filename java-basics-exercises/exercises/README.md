## Overview
### The Challenge
This was a simple challenge proposed to test the knowledge acquired during classes on Java's basic sintax and code structure. The idea was to create a simple banking system that could create an account and withdraw a value. The deposit functionality and conditional checkings were added on my own voliton.

### My Process
Built with simple java syntax and my current knowledge in the language. Hopefully I can come back to this and improve it by implemeting cleaner code, tests and OOP.

### What I learned
I learned how to read user input via the `Scanner` class, the existing data types in Java, how to setup conditional flows and the application of separation of concerns with simple methods, avoiding a single bloated `main` method.
